# ðŸ›’ Retail Data Warehouse Project

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project demonstrates a cloud-based retail data pipeline using **AWS Services**. It automates the ingestion, transformation, storage, and visualization of retail sales data for reporting and analytics purposes.

---

## ðŸ§± Architecture

1. **Input S3 Bucket**  
   Raw retail CSV files are uploaded here.

2. **AWS Lambda**  
   Acts as a trigger for every new file uploaded to the input S3 bucket.

3. **AWS Glue Job**  
   Processes and transforms the raw CSV data into a structured **Parquet** format.

4. **Output S3 Bucket**  
   Stores the transformed parquet files.

5. **Amazon Redshift**  
   Serves as the data warehouse. The processed data is loaded from the output S3 bucket into Redshift for analytics and reporting.

6. **Power BI**  
   Connected to Redshift (using Redshift ODBC or Athena ODBC) to visualize sales data through interactive dashboards.
